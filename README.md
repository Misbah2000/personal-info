# About Me : I am a Commerce graduate (B.Com, CGPA 8.98) with a strong academic background and a growing passion for data. After completing my graduation, I took a short career break to     #  focus on personal responsibilities and self-development. During this time, I discovered my interest in data-driven technologies, which led me to pursue a professional course in Data      #   Science and Data Analytics with AI. I have gained skills in Excel, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Python, NumPy, Machine Learning, and AI, and I am now eager to apply them in real-world        #   business   3challenges. I am a quick learner, detail-oriented, and excited to begin my career in Data Analytics and Data Science.
